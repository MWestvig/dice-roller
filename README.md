# dice-roller

This is my first actual project, very basic, but everyone has to start somewhere.
As the name suggests, it is a basic dice rolling simulator. It generates a random integer between 1 and 6 for the user and then asks whether the user would like to roll again, if not, it exits and thanks the user for rolling.
I'll probably come back to it to see if I can structure it better at some point. But for now it works and I'm happy with that.
